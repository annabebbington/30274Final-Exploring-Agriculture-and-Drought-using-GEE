# 30274Final-Exploring-Agriculture-and-Drought-using-GEE

This Google Earth Engine tutorial uses two raster datasets. The [GFSAD dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_GFSAD1000_V1)  from the Global Food-Security Suppport Analysis Data Project maps where global cropland is rainfed or irrigated. 
> The GFSAD is a NASA-funded project to provide high-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics.

The [GRIDMET DROUGHT: CONUS Drought Incides](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GRIDMET_DROUGHT) provides multiple drought indices at 4km resolution. This tutorial uses the standardised precipitation index (SPI), which follows the follwing breakdown. 

> 2.0 or more (extremely wet)
> 1.6 to 1.99 (very wet)
> 1.3 to 1.59 (moderately wet),
> 0.8 to 1.29 (slightly wet)
> 0.5 to 0.79 (incipient wet spell)
> -0.49 to 0.49(near normal),
> -0.79 to -0.5 (incipient dry spell)
> -1.29 to -0.8 (mild drought)
> -1.59 to -1.3 (moderate drought)
> -1.99 to -1.6 (severe drought)
> -2.0 or less (extreme drought).
