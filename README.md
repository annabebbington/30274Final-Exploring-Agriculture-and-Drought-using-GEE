# 30274Final-Exploring-Agriculture-and-Drought-using-GEE

This Google Earth Engine tutorial uses two raster datasets. The [GFSAD](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_GFSAD1000_V1) dataset from the Global Food-Security Suppport Analysis Data Project maps where global cropland is rainfed or irrigated. 
> The GFSAD is a NASA-funded project to provide high-resolution global cropland data and their water use that contributes towards global food security in the twenty-first century. The GFSAD products are derived through multi-sensor remote sensing data (e.g., Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR), secondary data, and field-plot data and aims at documenting cropland dynamics.
